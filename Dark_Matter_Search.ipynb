    "\n",
    "Dark Matter is a hypothesised type of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic force. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible. So how has it been hypothesised? During various observations, astrophysicists have found that there isn't enough matter in space to account for all the gravitational attractions we measure! Therefore, there must be some invisible matter interacting with visible matter through Gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one example quickly: gravitational lensing. It is when light gets bent around objects in space due to the gravitational fields around massive bodies. This lets you see behind objects in space!\n",

    "\n",
    "We see that mass has an effect on the path that light travels, so how does this relate to dark matter? Astrophysicists have seen light from distant objects that have been gravitationally lensed 'too much' - with the amount of observable mass causing the lensing, they should not see some objects that they in fact do! This then implies that there must be some more mass there that we can't see - dark matter!\n",

It is a massive 46 metres long and 25 metres in diameter! You can explore a 3D model of the detector [here](http://opendata.atlas.cern/detector-app/) and learn more about its different parts and tools [here](https://atlas.cern/discover/detector). \n",

    "\n",
    "So if dark matter is so common across the universe and its effects are clearly observed by astrophysicists, it should be easy to create and observe it using the ATLAS detector, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not. Because we can't directly observe dark matter, there are many hypotheses of what it actually is. One hypothesis, or model, that we will be searching for is called a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess from the name, this type of dark matter particle is hard to detect because it doesn't really interact with other things. For example WIMPs don't interact with electromagnetic radiation, including light. Hence, we can't see them!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we do to detect dark matter? Well if we can't see the dark matter around us, let's make the dark matter ourselves and see what happens!\n",
    "\n",
    "At the LHC we collide particles together and look at new particles that are created from these collisions. What we can do is collide protons and look to see if any of those collisions produce dark matter particles! In the next section, we'll specifically look at the hypothesised process that creates dark matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus our search in **invisibly decaying Higgs boson** or dark matter candidates produced in association with a **leptonically decaying Z boson** in proton–proton collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search is carried out in a final state with two isolated electrons or muons from a Z boson decay and large missing transverse momentum (ETmiss) due to an invisible Higgs boson decay or a WIMP pair (ll + ETmiss).\n",

Usually, we try to generate as many events as possible given the available computer resources (MC simulation is computationally very hard) so we usually have more MC events than real data events.
